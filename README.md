# Quiz made with React.


# Getting started

* Created repo on GitHub: https://github.com/RobertAhlin/react-quiz
* Cloned and opened with VS Code.
* App created with Vite: `npm init vite@latest . -- --template react`
* Ran `npm installÂ´
* App started with: `npm run dev`

* Selected Axios for my API handling. Installed with `npm install axios`

# API
The API file, `Api.jsx`, contains a function named `fetchQuizQuestions` responsible for fetching quiz questions from an external API. Here's an explanation of its functionality:

### fetchQuizQuestions Function:
- This function is an asynchronous function, indicating that it performs an asynchronous operation, such as making an HTTP request.
- It utilizes the `axios` library to perform the HTTP GET request to the specified API endpoint.
- The API endpoint used is `'https://opentdb.com/api.php'`, which is the Open Trivia Database API.
- Query parameters are appended to the URL to specify the number of questions (`amount`), category (`category`), difficulty (`difficulty`), type of questions (`type`), and encoding (`encode`). In this case, it requests 10 questions of easy difficulty from the category with ID 18 (Computers) and the type of multiple-choice questions.
- Upon successful retrieval of data from the API, it checks if the response data contains an array of quiz questions (`data.results`).
- If the data format is valid (i.e., it contains an array of questions), it formats each question by combining the incorrect answers with the correct answer into an `answers` array.
- The formatted questions are returned as an array of objects, where each object represents a single quiz question with its associated answers.
- If there's an error during the API request or the data format is invalid, it throws an error with an appropriate message.

Overall, this function serves to fetch quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API and format them for use in the quiz application. It encapsulates the logic for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and formatting the retrieved data.

# Components

# Project Assessment

## For G (Passing Requirements):
- [x] **React Setup:**  
It is set up with a React project using `create-react-app`.
- [x] **Function Components:**  
Project includes at least 5 function components 
    1. ErrorComponent
    2. LoadingComponent
    3. NextButtonComponent
    4. ProgressBarComponent
    5. QuestionComponent
    6. QuizComponent
    7. QuizResultComponent
    8. RestartButtonComponent

- [x] **API Data Fetching:**  
Data is fetched from an external API using Axios in the `fetchQuizQuestions` function in `Api.jsx`.

- [x] **CSS-in-JS Styling:**  
Components are styled using "css-in-js" approach with Styled Components.
    1. **LoadingComponent.jsx**: Defines a loading spinner with styles using styled-components.
    2. **NextButtonComponent.jsx**: Styles the next button with styled-components.
    3. **ProgressBarComponent.jsx**: Styles the progress bar with styled-components.
    4. **QuizArea** in **QuizComponent.jsx**: Wraps the quiz area and applies styling using styled-components.
    5. **QuizResultContainer**, **QuestionContainer**, **CorrectAnswer**, and **IncorrectAnswer** in **QuizResultComponent.jsx**: Styled components used to format the quiz result display.

- [x] **Hooks Usage:**
1. useReducer:
In the QuizProvider component within QuizContext.jsx, useReducer is used to manage the state and dispatch actions.  
2. useContext:
In the useQuizState and useQuizDispatch custom hooks within QuizContext.jsx, useContext is used to access the state and dispatch functions from the context provider. Here's how it's implemented:

## For VG (Additional Requirements for Higher Grade):
- [x] **Component Count:**
See function component section.  
Additionally, the App component in App.jsx is also a component, but it serves as the entry point of the application and does not render any UI components directly.
- [x] **Code Formatting:**
The code formatting is consistent, Prettier extension is installed in VS Code.
- [ ] **Unit Testing & Error Handling:** Your project seems to demonstrate unit testing and error handling, as evident from the presence of error components and the logic for error handling in fetching quiz questions.
